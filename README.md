He can also check on his patients, read their medical files and update it. Doctor can read the medical file and update to it through an API that is given to our website (Medlife), and it is secured enough, so the one who needs to update the medical file must have an access to the Medfile database through API that will be shared with him. In this way doctors from different hospitals and even in their clinics can add to the medical file and share their diagnosis and prescription with other doctors. This is our sharable medical file. Doctor can also request a lab or radiology test. The dashboard is accessible from his side, allowing him to see the overall number of patients, check his daily appointments, and view new patients with their status (critical or not) . Finally, he has the option of changing the password.
